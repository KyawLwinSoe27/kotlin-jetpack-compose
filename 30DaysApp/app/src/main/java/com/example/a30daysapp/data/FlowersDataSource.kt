Because of this, they require moderate temperatures and light, which can easily be found and controlled inside of homes. However, some indoor gardeners shy away from growing them because their care can be intimidating. These plants come in almost every color and have a frilly or fringed texture to the petals. They will bloom nearly every day if in bright and dependable lighting. The foliage is typically green or variegated, with a slight fuzz in texture."

It forms drooping six-inch-long clusters of pea-like lilac-colored flowers, which give off a delightful aroma. American Wisteria is less damaging to structures than Chinese or Japanese species.
